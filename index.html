    <p class="quote">I love MedMinder! Not only did I create it, I made it easy for anyone to use. Gone are the days of remembering to remind my family members to take their meds; it's all done for me!</p>
    <p class="author">~ Julian Rudolph</p>
    <p class="quote">I don't always remember to take my meds. My Grandson has to remind me almost daily. I wasn't sure what I was going to do when he had to leave for work. Now I know I can trust MedMinder to give me a call when it's time to take my meds. Three things in life are 'for sure': 1) Death,  2) Taxes, and 3) MedMinder</p>

    <p class="quote">I don't have time to remind my elderly mother to take her meds. I have to work, I don't always have my phone on me. I don't have to worry any more! My Nephew did a great job creating this program!</p>
